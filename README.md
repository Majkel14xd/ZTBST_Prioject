# Advanced security techniques for ICT networks - Project University

## Introduction

The project involves designing an extensive LAN/WAN network and implementing solutions that minimize the risk of security threats. Down
the most important solutions that need to be implemented include VLAN configuration, port and STP security, and implementation of appropriate lists
access control (ACL), wireless connection security (e.g. WPA2), zone-based firewall, implementation of VPN/IPsec tunnels,
activating SSH-based remote access, as well as defining an individual role-based command-line interface (Views).
